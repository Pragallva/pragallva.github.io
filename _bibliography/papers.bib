	abstract = {Abstract A moist static energy (MSE) framework for zonal-mean storm-track intensity, defined as the extremum of zonal-mean transient eddy MSE flux, is derived and applied across a range of time scales. According to the framework, storm-track intensity can be decomposed into contributions from net energy input [sum of shortwave absorption and surface heat fluxes into the atmosphere minus outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and atmospheric storage] integrated poleward of the storm-track position and MSE flux by the mean meridional circulation or stationary eddies at the storm-track position. The framework predicts storm-track decay in spring and amplification in fall in response to seasonal insolation. When applied diagnostically the framework shows shortwave absorption and land turbulent surface heat fluxes account for the seasonal evolution of Northern Hemisphere (NH) intensity; however, they are partially compensated by OLR (Planck feedback) and stationary eddy MSE flux. The negligible amplitude of Southern Hemisphere (SH) seasonal intensity is consistent with the compensation of shortwave absorption by OLR and oceanic turbulent surface heat fluxes (ocean energy storage). On interannual time scales, El Niño minus La Niña conditions amplify the NH storm track, consistent with decreased subtropical stationary eddy MSE flux. Finally, on centennial time scales, the CO2 indirect effect (sea surface temperature warming) amplifies the NH summertime storm track whereas the direct effect (increased CO2 over land) weakens it, consistent with opposing turbulent surface heat flux responses over land and ocean.},

	abstract = {Abstract Recently Nakamura and Huang proposed a semiempirical, one-dimensional model of atmospheric blocking based on the observed budget of local wave activity in the boreal winter. The model dynamics is akin to that of traffic flow, wherein blocking manifests as traffic jams when the streamwise flux of local wave activity reaches capacity. Stationary waves modulate the jet stream’s capacity to transmit transient waves and thereby localize block formation. Since the model is inexpensive to run numerically, it is suited for computing blocking statistics as a function of climate variables from large-ensemble, parameter sweep experiments. We explore sensitivity of blocking statistics to (i) stationary wave amplitude, (ii) background jet speed, and (iii) transient eddy forcing, using frequency, persistence, and prevalence as metrics. For each combination of parameters we perform 240 runs of 180-day simulations with aperiodic transient eddy forcing, each time randomizing the phase relations in forcing. The model climate shifts rapidly from a block-free state to a block-dominant state as the stationary wave amplitude is increased and/or the jet speed is decreased. When eddy forcing is increased, prevalence increases similarly but frequency decreases as blocks merge and become more persistent. It is argued that the present-day climate lies close to the boundary of the two states and hence its blocking statistics are sensitive to climate perturbations. The result underscores the low confidence in GCM-based assessment of the future trend of blocking under a changing climate, while it also provides a theoretical basis for evaluating model biases and understanding trends in reanalysis data.},

	abstract = {Abstract Storm tracks shift meridionally in response to forcing across a range of time scales. Here the authors formulate a moist static energy (MSE) framework for storm-track position and use it to understand storm-track shifts in response to seasonal insolation, El Niño minus La Niña conditions, and direct (increased CO2 over land) and indirect (increased sea surface temperature) effects of increased CO2. Two methods (linearized Taylor series and imposed MSE flux divergence) are developed to quantify storm-track shifts and decompose them into contributions from net energy (MSE input to the atmosphere minus atmospheric storage) and MSE flux divergence by the mean meridional circulation and stationary eddies. Net energy is not a dominant contribution across the time scales considered. The stationary eddy contribution dominates the storm-track shift in response to seasonal insolation, El Niño minus La Niña conditions, and CO2 direct effect in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas the mean meridional circulation contribution dominates the shift in response to CO2 indirect effect during northern winter and in the Southern Hemisphere during May and October. Overall, the MSE framework shows the seasonal storm-track shift in the Northern Hemisphere is connected to the stationary eddy MSE flux evolution. Furthermore, the equatorward storm-track shift during northern winter in response to El Niño minus La Niña conditions involves a different regime than the poleward shift in response to increased CO2 even though the tropical upper troposphere warms in both cases.},

	abstract = {Abstract The observed zonal-mean extratropical storm tracks exhibit distinct hemispheric seasonality. Previously, the moist static energy (MSE) framework was used diagnostically to show that shortwave absorption (insolation) dominates seasonality but surface heat fluxes damp seasonality in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) and amplify it in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). Here we establish the causal role of surface fluxes (ocean energy storage) by varying the mixed layer depth d in zonally symmetric 1) slab-ocean aquaplanet simulations with zero ocean energy transport and 2) energy balance model (EBM) simulations. Using a scaling analysis we define a critical mixed layer depth dc and hypothesize 1) large mixed layer depths (d {\textgreater} dc) produce surface heat fluxes that are out of phase with shortwave absorption resulting in small storm track seasonality and 2) small mixed layer depths (d {\textless} dc) produce surface heat fluxes that are in phase with shortwave absorption resulting in large storm track seasonality. The aquaplanet simulations confirm the large mixed layer depth hypothesis and yield a useful idealization of the SH storm track. However, the small mixed layer depth hypothesis fails to account for the large contribution of the Ferrel cell and atmospheric storage. The small mixed layer limit does not yield a useful idealization of the NH storm track because the seasonality of the Ferrel cell contribution is opposite to the stationary eddy contribution in the NH. Varying the mixed layer depth in an EBM qualitatively supports the aquaplanet results.},

	abstract = {The composite structure of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) has long been known to feature pronounced Rossby gyres in 
	the subtropical upper troposphere, whose existence can be interpreted as the forced response to convective heating anomalies in the
	presence of a subtropical westerly jet. Here we inquire as to whether these forced gyre circulations have any subsequent effects on 
	divergence patterns in the tropics. A nonlinear spherical shallow water model is used to investigate how the introduction of different 
	background jet profiles affects the model’s steady-state response to an imposed MJO-like thermal forcing. Results show that a stronger 
	jet leads to a stronger Kelvin-mode response in the tropics up to a critical jet speed, along with stronger divergence anomalies in the 
	vicinity of the forcing. To understand this behavior, additional calculations are performed in which a localized vorticity forcing is 
	imposed in the extratropics, without any thermal forcing in the tropics. The response is once again seen to include pronounced equatorial 
	Kelvin waves, provided the jet is of sufficient amplitude. A detailed analysis of the vorticity budget reveals that the zonal-mean zonal 
	wind shear plays a key role in amplifying the Kelvin-mode divergent winds near the equator. These results help to explain why the MJO tends 
	to be strongest during boreal winter when the Indo-Pacific jet is typically at its strongest.} }

	abstract = {The Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) is characterized by horizontal circulation anomalies in the upper-troposphere whose structure can be broadly 
	regarded as the superposition of Kelvin and Rossby modes excited in response to a tropical heat source moving slowly eastward in the presence of a subtropical jet. 
	Earlier studies showed that the strength of the jet is important for determining the amplitude and phasing of the Rossby-mode response. More recent studies have shown 
	that the jet strength has an equally important effect on the Kelvin-mode response, indicating that the Rossby and Kelvin modes are coupled to each other in the presence 
	of horizontal wind shear. To further our understanding about the underlying dynamics associated with the MJO’s horizontal circulation, we propose a simple analytical theory 
	for the shear-mediated coupling between the two modes. Our theoretical Rossby-Kelvin system is able to capture the salient features of the upper-tropospheric horizontal structure 
	of the MJO and explains the jet-MJO relationship seen in numerical model experiments. Results of this study have implications for the commonly used weak-temperature gradient 
	approximation for the MJO, suggesting that in addition to tropical heating, off-equatorial dynamical forcings plays an important role on its upper-level divergence. A linear stability

	abstract = {Atmospheric blocking represents persistent meandering of the jet stream that disrupt 
	the eastward migration of extratropical transient eddies. Recently, Nakamura and Huang (2018) proposed 
	a semi-empirical theory for block formation which suggests that atmospheric blockings are similar to 
	`traffic-jam on a highway'. Here we use the finite-amplitude local wave activity (LWA) framework with 
	reanalysis dataset to identify signatures of traffic-jam mechanism during block formation. Using LWA budget 
	and a feature tracking algorithm, we perform a careful analysis of major persistent anomalies in the jet streams 
	during the Northern Hemisphere winter. We show that most of the persistent anomalies occur in clusters collocated 
	with the quasi-stationary ridge over the Euro-Atlantic sector and the Pacific sector. In the Atlantic sector, 
	the zonal LWA flux dominates for longer timescale (up to ~20 days), whereas in the Pacific sector, both diabatic 
	heating and zonal LWA flux play equally important role in the wave activity budget. We show that most persistent 
	events are associated with stronger nonlinear modification of large-amplitude Rossby waves. In such cases the total 
	LWA flux is effectively suppressed. In contrast, the short-lived anomalous events are associated with weaker nonlinear 
	component of LWA flux which results in ineffective flux suppression. For both persistent and short-lived events the zonal 
	LWA flux reaches a tipping point for spontaneous accumulation of LWA. Overall, we show that despite substantial variations 
	among individual events most of the long-lived events fall into the canonical description of the traffic-jam behavior}}
