	abstract = {Storm tracks shift meridionally in response to forcing across a range of time scales. Here the authors formulate a moist static energy (MSE) framework for storm-track position and use it to understand storm-track shifts in response to seasonal insolation, El Niño minus La Niña conditions, and direct (increased CO2 over land) and indirect (increased sea surface temperature) effects of increased CO2. Two methods (linearized Taylor series and imposed MSE flux divergence) are developed to quantify storm-track shifts and decompose them into contributions from net energy (MSE input to the atmosphere minus atmospheric storage) and MSE flux divergence by the mean meridional circulation and stationary eddies. Net energy is not a dominant contribution across the time scales considered. The stationary eddy contribution dominates the storm-track shift in response to seasonal insolation, El Niño minus La Niña conditions, and CO2 direct effect in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas the mean meridional circulation contribution dominates the shift in response to CO2 indirect effect during northern winter and in the Southern Hemisphere during May and October. Overall, the MSE framework shows the seasonal storm-track shift in the Northern Hemisphere is connected to the stationary eddy MSE flux evolution. Furthermore, the equatorward storm-track shift during northern winter in response to El Niño minus La Niña conditions involves a different regime than the poleward shift in response to increased CO2 even though the tropical upper troposphere warms in both cases.},

	abstract = {The composite structure of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) has long been known to feature pronounced Rossby gyres in 
	the subtropical upper troposphere, whose existence can be interpreted as the forced response to convective heating anomalies in the
	presence of a subtropical westerly jet. Here we inquire as to whether these forced gyre circulations have any subsequent effects on 
	divergence patterns in the tropics. A nonlinear spherical shallow water model is used to investigate how the introduction of different 
	background jet profiles affects the model’s steady-state response to an imposed MJO-like thermal forcing. Results show that a stronger 
	jet leads to a stronger Kelvin-mode response in the tropics up to a critical jet speed, along with stronger divergence anomalies in the 
	vicinity of the forcing. To understand this behavior, additional calculations are performed in which a localized vorticity forcing is 
	imposed in the extratropics, without any thermal forcing in the tropics. The response is once again seen to include pronounced equatorial 
	Kelvin waves, provided the jet is of sufficient amplitude. A detailed analysis of the vorticity budget reveals that the zonal-mean zonal 
	wind shear plays a key role in amplifying the Kelvin-mode divergent winds near the equator. These results help to explain why the MJO tends 
	to be strongest during boreal winter when the Indo-Pacific jet is typically at its strongest.} }
